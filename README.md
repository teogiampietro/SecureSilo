# SecureSilo

## Summary

SecureSilo is a security and control system for bag silos. 
It allows to obtain daily measurements thanks to devices incorporated to the bag silos, by means of which through updates via SMS-3G the system is fed with information in real time.

It also has motion sensors, so it controls the integrity of the grain, because if any anomaly is detected in them, it will send alarm messages and call the list of numbers that the customer wants.

Another important module for administrators, is the subscriptions module, where you can generate annual payment orders for users, notifying by email where and how to pay the monthly fee. Otherwise the system will deny access to the user, although it continues to take daily measurements for future regularity of the subscription.
